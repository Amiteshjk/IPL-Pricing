IPL Pricing Case in Business Analytics book by Dinesh Kumar

We have been provided with list of 130 cricket players stats data who have participated in IPL in the past years. Every playerâ€™s name along with their team, number of wickets taken, number of runs scored, number of sixes hit, batting strike rate, bowling average, captaincy and Sold Price has been provided.

We need to understand the how the Sold Price of a player is affected based on the  variables like Sixers, Batting Strike rate and other metrics.

Solving below questions - 

Question 1 - Develop a simple linear regression model using sold price as response variable and the batting strike rate as explanatory variable. Comment on the model, is there an evidence to suggest that the batting strike rate has a statistically significant relationship with sold price.


Question 2 - Develop a multiple linear regression model between sold price and the batting strike rate and number of sixers. Compare this model with the model in question l. What conclusions can you reach based on both these models? 


Question 3 - Using model 1, test whether the sold price increases by at least $1000 for every unit increase in the batting strike rate at significance level of 0.05.
